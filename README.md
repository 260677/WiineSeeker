# WineSeeker Poblenou App

## Intro

WineSeeker is a wine searcher app developed with REACT abd Typescript focused mainly in supermarkets and small wine shops around Barcelona, right now especially centred in Poblenou. The search includes wine type (red, white or pink), price range, and a range of proximity defined by the user, up to 1KM. It also filters markets by their opening hours.

Wines are based also on a low - medium budget. So far the more expensive is 20 euros.

Throught the app, users can choose the best wine option near them, viewing the supermarket location in an map and the results of the search displayed under it. 

Once the user try the wine, they can leave a review from 1-5 and also a comment.
